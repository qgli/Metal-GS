V1.0 Probe: simdgroup_matrix 8x8 MMA for SH evaluation

SIMD Exploration (sh_simd.metal):
- Implemented simdgroup_float8x8 MMA kernel with diagonal extraction
- 8 Gaussians packed per simdgroup, correct results on matrix diagonal
- Feature guard with scalar fallback for M1/M2

Benchmark Results (M4, SH degree 3, 16 bases):
- Correctness: ALL PASS (max err 4.88e-04, within FP16 quantisation)
- Performance: 1.07x average (MMA ~= scalar), 1.76x peak at N=10K
- 87.5% off-diagonal waste cancels ~8x MMA hardware advantage
- Conclusion: SH eval not a natural MMA fit; focus on rasterize/preprocess
